## üåü Overview

**`gitops-maker`** is a modular, extensible, and production-ready CLI tool built in Python to generate standardized GitOps repositories. It accelerates the setup of IaC and deployment environments across multiple cloud providers and CI/CD platforms ‚Äî following best practices in GitOps, infrastructure modularity, and security.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ Scaffold GitOps repositories with ArgoCD, Kustomize, Helm, and Terraform
- üåç Supports multi-cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- üìÅ Auto-generates `envs/`, `modules/`, `atlantis.yaml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable templates via Cookiecutter and `.validate.yml`
- üîç Built-in validation with severity levels and CI/CD-friendly `--json` output
- üå≤ Preview directory structure before generating with `rich.tree`
- üîå Modular CLI powered by [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer)
- üß™ Pytest-ready architecture for testing CLI + core logic

## üß† Philosophy

`gitops-maker` is designed with these principles:

- **Hexagonal architecture:** clear separation of CLI, core logic, and templates
- **Security-first:** safe rendering, directory isolation, no shell injection
- **Extensibility:** easy to add new templates, environments, or modules
- **Observability:** rich CLI output, JSON for pipelines, consistent validation
- **Team-ready:** usable by Platform Engineers, SREs, and DevOps squads
